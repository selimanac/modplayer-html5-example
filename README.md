There is a small python script which you can update the `/archive/archive_files.json` file with music files data:

* Put this file alongside the index.html at the root of HTML5 Bundle
* Called with /asset/ path  
    `> python mod_file_parser.py /assets/audio`
* It will update the /archive/archive_files.json file with music data

I made some changes for testing [Mod Player](https://github.com/selimanac/defold-modplayer) extension. I hope I don't break things...
