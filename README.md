There is a small [python script](https://github.com/selimanac/modplayer-html5-example/blob/master/mod_file_parser.py) which you can update the `/archive/archive_files.json` file with music files data:

* Put [this](https://github.com/selimanac/modplayer-html5-example/blob/master/mod_file_parser.py) file alongside the index.html in the root of your HTML5 Bundle
* Run it with /asset/ path  
    `> python mod_file_parser.py /assets/audio`
* It will update the /archive/archive_files.json file with music data

I made some changes for testing [Mod Player](https://github.com/selimanac/defold-modplayer) extension. I hope I don't break things...
